                        A spunky, chubby teenager with gelled hair shot to fame after leading
                        India to glory in the Under-19 World Cup at Kuala Lumpur in early 2008.
                        In an Indian team filled with saint-like icons worthy of their own
                        hagiographies, Virat Kohli, with his most un-Indian, 'bad-boy'
                        intensity, would clearly be an outcast.
